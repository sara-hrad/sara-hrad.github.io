Data Processing: In this project, I was responsible for cleaning and processing clinical time-series data, including EEG signals. Model Identification: I employed data-driven techniques to identify the model of anesthesia and examined the robustness and performance of a controller designed based on the identified models. Neural Network Modeling: I utilized a regression neural network to generate a novel model of anesthesia that considers multi-drug effects. Reinforcement Learning (RL) Agent: As part of the research, I proposed an actor-critic (A2C) agent using deep RL for drug injection. This agent takes into account safety constraints and operates in a simulated environment based on the trained network. These contributions have been instrumental in advancing the field of automated anesthesia, increasing safety and efficiency in drug administration, and reducing the risk of overdose. Learning in Multi-Agent Systems (Ph.D. Research): I implemented various policy gradient algorithms for multi-agent systems, providing practical solutions for complex control problems. Additionally, my work includes offering theoretical insights into the performance of Reinforcement Learning (RL) in scenarios such as formation control of a swarm of robots and the control of the distributed power system contributing to the understanding of RL in real-world applications. Non-Local Control Approach for Nonlinear Systems (Internship at Honeywell): I led research focused on developing an innovative control approach for nonlinear systems utilizing data-driven non-local models. Throughout this research, I collaborated closely with a research principal from Honeywell Inc., fostering productive industry-academic cooperation. Optimal Control of Integrated Solar Thermal Systems (M.A.Sc. Reseach) I proposed a novel optimal control strategy for solar thermal systems, leading to significant increases in energy efficiency. You can access the related paper here. Additionally, I implemented computational optimization techniques to determine optimal configurations based on solar energy availability and energy efficiency. For further details, please refer to the corresponding paper here. Satellite Attitude Control (B.Sc. Research) I conducted in-depth research on satellite attitude control and devised an optimal controller using dynamic programming. This controller is designed to precisely control satellite attitudes using impulse thrusters. In the course of the research, I modeled the dynamics of a satellite in 3D using quaternion coordination and developed an optimal controller for satellite attitudes using the dynamic programming optimization technique. This innovative approach was a key feature of the project. To assess the effectiveness of the technique, I conducted thorough simulation analyses, providing valuable insights into the performance and viability of the developed control strategy.
