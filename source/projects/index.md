1. **AI PROTOTYPE OF SPINSIGHT MRI (TECH-E Course Project)**:
   - I created a **dashboard** using [Streamlit](https://github.com/sara-hrad/MRNet-app) to showcase the predictive capabilities of [MRNet](https://stanfordmlgroup.github.io/competitions/mrnet/), a deep neural network, in diagnosing an ACL tear in the knee.

   - Furthermore, I conducted comprehensive **business model analyses** to validate the feasibility and viability of the **Spinsight MRI** project.

2. **Undergraduate Coanda UAV Project***:

   As an undergraduate student, I was part of a dedicated team that successfully designed and built a prototype of a Coanda Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). This project allowed me to gain hands-on experience in aircraft design and engineering, as well as the principles of aerodynamics. Our team's achievement in creating a functional UAV prototype demonstrated our ability to collaborate effectively and apply theoretical knowledge to real-world engineering challenges.
