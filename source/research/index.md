## AI Medical Imaging (Research Intern)
 **Oct 2024 - May 2025**
 **Supervisor: [Dr. Philip Edgcumbe](http://edgcumbe.ca/)**

I developed and validated an MLP algorithm to classify abnormalities in the NIH X-ray dataset using the Google CXR foundation model. (0.93 AUC for test dataset with 0.95% confidence interval (0.90, 0.96)). I also converted VGH CT scan to X-ray DICOMs for the next stage of our research.

## AI-Assisted Anesthesia (Ph.D. Research):
 **2020 - Present**
 **Supervisor: Prof. Guy Dumont**

I led the research project on AI-Assisted Anesthesia, and as a result, one manuscript has been accepted for publication in the Journal of Clinical Monitoring and Computing, while another manuscript is currently in progress. 
<!-- You can find the accepted manuscript [here](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/i55y1bcum5c1ufwjriyow/Paper.pdf?rlkey=laozg4bdug1iw3it1yk9lhcuc&dl=0). -->

1. **Data Processing:** In this project, I was responsible for cleaning and processing clinical time-series data, including EEG signals.

2. **Model Identification:** I employed data-driven techniques to identify the model of anesthesia and Validated the robustness and performance of a controller designed based on the identified models ([paper](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10877-023-01083-5)).

3. **Anesthesia Response Simulation:** My master student collaborator and I developed a comprehensive multi-variable simulation of anesthesia as a Python package and a Matlab toolbox. (paper in progress)

4. **Automation of Anesthesia:** As part of the research, I am developing a  multi-objective RL agent for multi-loop control and multi-drug injection, considering safety constraint and comparing it with a classical predictive controller.

These contributions have been instrumental in advancing the field of automated anesthesia, increasing safety and efficiency in drug administration, and reducing the risk of overdose.

## [Learning in Multi-Agent Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13476) (Ph.D. Research):
 **2022- 2024**
 **Supervisor: Prof. Maryam Kamgarpour**

<!-- - I implemented various **model-based and model-free policy gradient algorithms** for multi-agent systems, providing practical solutions for complex control problems. -->
- My work offers theoretical insights into the performance of Reinforcement Learning (RL) in scenarios such as formation control of a **swarm of robots** and the control of the distributed power system contributing to the understanding of RL in real-world applications.

## Non-Local Control Approach for Nonlinear Systems (Research intern at Honeywell): 
**May 2019-Oct 2019**

- I led research focused on developing an innovative control approach for **nonlinear systems** utilizing data-driven non-local models.

- Throughout this research, I collaborated closely with a research principal from **Honeywell Inc.**, fostering productive industry-academic cooperation.

## Optimal Control of Integrated Solar Thermal Systems (M.A.Sc. Reseach):
 **2016 - 2018**

- I proposed a novel **optimal control strategy** for **solar thermal systems**, leading to significant increases in energy efficiency. You can access the related paper [here](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jprocont.2019.09.008).

- Additionally, I implemented **computational optimization techniques** to determine optimal configurations based on solar energy availability and energy efficiency. For further details, please refer to the corresponding paper [here](https://doi.org/10.23919/ACC.2017.7963396).

## Other Projects:

**[Lane Detection For Autonomous Driving](https://github.com/sara-hrad/Lane-detection-rad)**:
- Implemented image segmentation approach, UNET on a Kaggle dataset, for detecting lane (code).
- Achieved 99.65 accuracy and 0.88 dice score.

**Satellite Attitude Control (B.Sc. Research)**
**Summer 2015**

- I conducted in-depth research on **satellite attitude control** and devised an optimal controller using **dynamic programming**. This controller is designed to precisely control satellite attitudes using impulse thrusters.

- In the course of the research, I modeled the 3DoF dynamics of a satellite using quaternion coordination and developed an optimal controller for satellite attitudes using the dynamic programming optimization technique. This innovative approach was a key feature of the project.

- To assess the effectiveness of the technique, I conducted thorough simulation analyses, providing valuable insights into the performance and viability of the developed control strategy.

**[AI PROTOTYPE](https://github.com/sara-hrad/MRNet-app) OF SPINSIGHT MRI (TECH-E Course Project)**:
- As a team, we created a **dashboard** using Streamlit to showcase the performance of an ACL classifier, [MRNet](https://stanfordmlgroup.github.io/competitions/mrnet/) on a MRI dataset.

- Furthermore, we conducted comprehensive **business model analyses** to validate the feasibility and viability of the **Spinsight MRI** project.

**Undergraduate Coanda VTOL Project:**

As an undergraduate student, I was part of a dedicated team that successfully designed and built a prototype of a Coanda Vertical Take-off and Landing (VTOL). This project allowed me to gain hands-on experience in aircraft design and engineering, as well as the principles of aerodynamics. Our team's achievement in creating a functional UAV prototype demonstrated our ability to collaborate effectively and apply theoretical knowledge to real-world engineering challenges. -->
